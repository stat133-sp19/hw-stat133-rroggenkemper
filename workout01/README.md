The big-picture purpose of this assignment was to clean, visualize, and analyze data about all the shots taken by five NBA players in the 2016 season. 

The first part of the assignment consists of downloading and cleaning the data. The second consists of making scatterplots of shots overlayed on top of images of half of a basketball court, so it's possible to visualize where shots were made and missed from. The last part of the assignment consists of analyzing the data, and writing up a report based on that analysis.
